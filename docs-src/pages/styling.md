# 🎨 Styling

<div>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Keep your components’ styles self-contained while supporting shared design tokens.</strong> Le Truc offers a refreshingly simple approach to create reactive Web Components that enhance your existing HTML.</p>
  {{ toc }}
</div>
</section-hero>

## Design Principles

Le Truc is focused on **state management and reactivity**, not styling. However, to **ensure consistent, maintainable, and reusable styles**, we recommend techniques that **scope component styles properly while allowing shared design tokens** (e.g., spacing, font sizes, colors, layout grids).

- **Each component brings along its own specific styles.**
- Component styles should be **scoped or encapsulated** so they don't leak out.
- **Allow customizations** via CSS custom properties or pre-defined classes.

Parent components may apply styles to the wrapper element of known sub-components for layout purposes. But avoid styling inner elements of sub-components directly. This would tightly couple the styles of the outer and inner components.

## Scope Styles to Custom Element

Use the **custom element name** to scope component styles if **you control the page and the components within**. This protects against component styles leaking out, while still allowing to use the CSS cascade. No need for Shadow DOM, no duplicate style rules.

```css
my-component {
  & button {
    /* Button style rules */
  }

  /* More selectors for inner elements */
}
```

### Advantages of Custom Element Names

- By definition **unique within the document** with a descriptive name.
- **Low specificity**, making it easy to override when you need to with a single class.

<card-callout class="tip">

**When to use**

**Best when** you control the page and need styles to cascade naturally.
**Avoid if** you expect style clashes from third-party styles.

## Encapsulate Styles with Shadow DOM

Use **Shadow DOM** to encapsulate styles if your component is going to be used in a pages **where you don't control the styles**. This way you make sure page styles don't leak in and component styles don't leak out.

```html
<my-component>
  <template shadowrootmode="open">
    <style>
      button {
        /* Button style rules */
      }

      /* More selectors for inner elements */
    </style>
    <!-- Inner elements -->
  </template>
</my-component>
```

<card-callout class="tip">

**When to use**

**Best when** your component is used in environments where you don’t control styles.
**Avoid if** you need global styles to apply inside the component.

</card-callout>

## Shared Design Tokens with CSS Custom Properties

Web Components can't inherit global styles inside **Shadow DOM**, but CSS custom properties allow components to remain **flexible and themeable**.

### Defining Design Tokens

Set global tokens in a stylesheet:

```css
:root {
  --button-bg: #007bff;
  --button-text: #fff;
  --spacing: 1rem;
}
```

### Using Tokens in a Component

```css
my-component {
  padding: var(--spacing);

  & button {
    background: var(--button-bg);
    color: var(--button-text);
  }
}
```

### Advantages of CSS Custom Properties

- **Supports theming** – users can override styles globally.
- **Works inside Shadow DOM** – unlike normal CSS, custom properties are inherited inside the shadow tree.

## Defined Variants with Classes

Use **classes** if your components can appear in a **limited set of specific manifestations**. For example, buttons could come in certain sizes and have primary, secondary and tertiary variants.

```css
my-button {
  /* Style rules for default (medium-sized, secondary) buttons */

  &.small {
    /* Style rules for small buttons */
  }

  &.large {
    /* Style rules for large buttons */
  }

  &.primary {
    /* Style rules for primary buttons */
  }

  &.tertiary {
    /* Style rules for tertiary buttons */
  }
}
```

## CSS-only Components

Just because Le Truc is a JavaScript library doesn't mean you have to use JavaScript in every component. It's perfectly fine to use custom elements just for styling purposes.

Here's the example of the `<card-callout>` we're using in this documentation:

<module-demo>
	<div class="preview">
		<card-callout>This is an informational message.</card-callout>
		<card-callout class="tip">Remember to hydrate while coding!</card-callout>
		<card-callout class="caution">Be careful with this operation.</card-callout>
		<card-callout class="danger">This action is irreversible!</card-callout>
		<card-callout class="note">This is just a side note.</card-callout>
	</div>
	<details>
		<summary>Source Code</summary>
		<module-lazy src="./examples/card-callout.html">
			<card-callout>
				<p class="loading" role="status" aria-live="polite">Loading...</p>
				<p class="error" role="alert" aria-live="assertive" hidden></p>
			</card-callout>
		</module-lazy>
	</details>
</module-demo>
