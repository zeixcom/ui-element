## What is UIElement?

**UIElement** is a lightweight JavaScript library that lets you build interactive Web Components without requiring a full JavaScript framework like React or Vue.

It **works with your existing server-rendered HTML**, enhancing it with stateful, reusable components that hydrate automatically â€“ even when inserted dynamically.

* âœ… **Works with any backend** â€“ No need for a JavaScript-first stack like Next.js.
* âœ… **No build tools required** â€“ Just drop in components and they work.
* âœ… **Minimal JavaScript footprint** â€“ Less code over the wire, less complexity.
* âœ… **Future-proof** â€“ Web Components donâ€™t break with framework updates.

## Why Use UIElement?

If youâ€™re looking for a simple, **framework-free way to add interactivity** to your web pages, UIElement is the perfect fit.

* **Enhancing Server-Rendered Pages**: Add client-side behavior to static HTML without worrying about hydration mismatches.
* **Creating Standalone Web Components**: Build self-contained UI elements that work anywhere â€” inside any CMS, e-commerce site, or dashboard.
* **Adding Lightweight Interactivity**: Skip the complexity of React or Vue for simple UI elements like tabs, counters, and interactive lists.
* **Long-Term Stability**: Web Components outlive JavaScript frameworks release cycles â€“ your components wonâ€™t break with each major update.

## How UIElement Works

UIElement extends the native `HTMLElement` class, letting you define **custom Web Components** that manage state with minimal code.

Unlike traditional frameworks that rely on a virtual DOM or dirty-checking, UIElement synchronizes automic pieces of state (signals) directly with the DOM, making fine-grained updates **fast and efficient**.

### Example: Counter Component

<component-demo>
<div class="preview">
<my-counter count="42">
<p>
Count: <span class="count"></span><br>
Parity: <span class="parity"></span>
</p>
<button type="button" class="decrement">âˆ’</button>
<button type="button" class="increment">+</button>
</my-counter>
</div>
<accordion-panel collapsible>
<details>
<summary>
<div class="summary">Source Code</div>
</summary>
<lazy-load src="./examples/my-counter.html">
<p class="loading">Loading...</p>
</lazy-load>
</details>
</accordion-panel>
</component-demo>

* âœ… **Zero re-renders** â€“ Only updates what changes.
* âœ… **No abstraction over the DOM** â€“ Works with plain HTML.
* âœ… **Fully self-contained** â€“ Can be used anywhere, even inside CMS templates.

## How UIElement Compares

* **No Virtual DOM**: Unlike React or Vue, UIElement updates HTML directly, avoiding unnecessary renders.
* **Minimal Overhead**: Since it builds on Web Components, it has minimal impact on performance and bundle size.
* **Simple API**: Few, clear concepts (signals, effects, context) allow developers to quickly build interactive components.
