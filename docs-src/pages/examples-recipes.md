## What You'll Learn

This collection of examples demonstrates a range of scenarios, from simple state updates in a single component to managing complex interactions across multiple components. Here's an overview of what you'll find:

* **Basic Composition**: `TabList` and `AccordionPanel` - See how a parent component can control the visibility of multiple child components, showcasing state sharing and communication between components.
* **Syntax Highlighting**: - See how wrapping content in a `CodeBlock` component enables syntax highlighting on the client, demonstrating integration with third-party libraries.
* **Fetching Data Example**: `LazyLoad` - Learn how to fetch content only when needed, handling asynchronous operations and updating state reactively as data is loaded.
* **Form Validation Example**: `InputField` with Client-Side & Server-Side Validation - Validate input fields based on requirements passed from the server and dynamically check the validity of entries, such as checking the availability of usernames via server requests.
* **Context Example**: `MediaContext` - Discover how to share state globally across components using context, with practical use cases like adapting to media queries and responsive design.

Whether you're getting started with a basic component or building a full-featured application, these examples will help you understand how to use `UIElement` effectively to build reactive Web Components.
