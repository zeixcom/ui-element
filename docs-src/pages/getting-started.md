# üöÄ Getting Started

<p class="lead"><strong>Set up UIElement in minutes ‚Äì no build tools required</strong>. Whether you‚Äôre enhancing server-rendered HTML with lightweight interactivity or integrating Web Components into a modern JavaScript project, UIElement makes it simple to get started.</p>
</section>

<section>

## How to Install UIElement

UIElement works **without build tools** but also supports **NPM and module bundlers** for larger projects. Choose the option that best fits your needs.

### Using a CDN

For the easiest setup, include <strong>UIElement</strong> via a CDN. This is ideal for **testing or quick projects** where you want lightweight interactivity without additional tooling.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@zeix/ui-element@latest/index.js"></script>
```

</section>

### Self-Hosting UIElement

For production use, you may want to **self-host UIElement** to avoid relying on a CDN. You can download the latest version from:

<a href="https://github.com/zeixcom/ui-element/blob/main/index.js" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>

Simply host the file on your server and include it like this:

```html
<script src="/path/to/your/hosted/ui-element.js"></script>
```

**Why self-host?**

- You **control updates** and avoid breaking changes from external CDNs.
- Works for **projects with stricter Content Security Policy rules**.

Remember to keep the hosted file updated to use the latest features and bug fixes.

### Installing via Package Managers

If you‚Äôre using a **bundler** like **Vite, Webpack, or Rollup**, install UIElement via NPM or Bun:

<tab-group>
<div role="tablist">
<button role="tab" id="trigger_installation-npm" aria-controls="panel_installation-npm" aria-selected="true" tabindex="0">NPM</button>
<button role="tab" id="trigger_installation-bun" aria-controls="panel_installation-bun" aria-selected="false" tabindex="-1">Bun</button>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="panel_installation-npm" aria-labelledby="trigger_installation-npm">

```bash
npm install @zeix/ui-element
```

</div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="panel_installation-bun" aria-labelledby="trigger_installation-bun">

```bash
bun add @zeix/ui-element
```

</div>
</tab-group>

Then import the needed functions in your JavaScript:

```js
import { component, on, RESET, setText } from '@zeix/ui-element'
```

## Creating Your First Component

Now, let's create an interactive Web Component to verify your setup.

**What This Component Does**

- Displays **‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù** by default.
- Updates dynamically when you **type into the input field**.

### Markup

Include the following in your server-rendered HTML:

```html
<hello-world>
	<label
		>Your name<br />
		<input type="text" />
	</label>
	<p>Hello, <span>World</span>!</p>
</hello-world>
```

### Component Definition

Save the following inside a `<script type="module">` tag or an external JavaScript file.

```html
<script type="module">
	import {
		component,
		on,
		RESET,
		setText,
	} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@zeix/ui-element@latest/index.js'

	component(
		'hello-world',
		{
			// Fall back to server-rendered content
			name: RESET,
		},
		(el, { first }) => [
			// Update content dynamically based on the "name" signal
			first('span', setText('name')),

			// Handle user input to change the "name"
			first(
				'input',
				on('input', e => {
					el.name = e.target.value || RESET
				}),
			),
		],
	)
</script>
```

**What Happens Here?**

- The `name: RESET` property **gets its initial value from the server-rendered content** (the `<span>` text).
- The `setText('name')` effect **syncs the state** with the `<span>`.
- The `on('input')` event **updates the state** whenever you type in the first `<input>` field, falling back to server-rendered value if empty.
- The Web Component **hydrates automatically** when inserted into the page.

## Understanding Your First Component

Let's break down each part of your hello-world component to understand how UIElement works:

### State Definition

```js
{
	name: RESET
}
```

This creates a reactive property called `name`:

- `RESET` means "use whatever text is already in the HTML" as the starting value
- UIElement automatically reads "World" from the `<span>` element as the initial value
- When `name` changes, any effects that depend on it automatically update

**Note:** This is one of three ways to initialize state in UIElement:

- **Direct values** like `name: "Guest"` for hardcoded defaults
- **Parser functions** like `name: asString()` to read from HTML attributes
- **RESET** to read from existing DOM content (what we're using here)

You'll learn about all three approaches in [Core Concepts](core-concepts.html).

### Effect Array

```js
[
  first("span", setText("name")),
  first("input", on("input", e => { ... }))
]
```

Effects define what happens when the component starts up:

- `first("span", setText("name"))` finds the first `<span>` and keeps its text in sync with the `name` property
- `first("input", on("input", ...))` finds the first `<input>` and adds an event listener
- Effects run automatically when the component is added to the page

### The RESET Pattern

`RESET` is particularly useful for server-rendered content:

```html
<hello-world>
	<p>Hello, <span>World</span>!</p>
</hello-world>
```

When the component initializes, it reads "World" from the `<span>` and uses that as the starting value for `name`. This allows your components to enhance existing HTML content seamlessly.

## Verifying Your Installation

If everything is set up correctly, you should see:

- A text input field
- A greeting (Hello, World!)
- The greeting updates as you type

<component-demo>
	<div class="preview">
		<hello-world>
			<template shadowrootmode="open">
				<label>Your name<br>
					<input type="text">
				</label>
				<p>Hello, <span>World</span>!</p>
			</template>
		</hello-world>
	</div>
</component-demo>

If it's not working:

- Check the browser console for errors (missing imports, typos).
- Ensure your `<script>` tag is set to `type="module"` when using ES modules.
- If using NPM, confirm UIElement is installed inside `node_modules/@zeix/ui-element`.
